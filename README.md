# Todo Taks

This is a simple Todo Tasks management app. 

### Features
You can add/delete/update tasks on your todo list.

I have used MERN stack to create this simple app and tailwindcss v3.4.17 for styling. I have merged both repositories (Backend/frontend) in one. You just need to clone the repository and run npm i command and change mongodb connection URI in backend/mongodb.js file or you can create .env file and keep mongodb connection URI in there.

### Functionalities

##### 1. User Authentication => Login/Signup
##### 2. Todo List => Create, Delete, Update Task status.


This repository/codes in it, free to use in your projects.
